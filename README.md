# Surgery Risk Analysis

This Machine Learning project analyzes surgical risk using patient data from cardiovascular procedures. It focuses on predicting neurological complications after surgery through exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and predictive modeling.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains relevant medical information from patients, including a target variable (`neuro`) that indicates whether the patient experienced a neurological condition after surgery.

## Project Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Apply Machine Learning models to predict surgical risks
- Evaluate model performance
- Use explainability techniques to interpret results

## Technologies and Tools

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
